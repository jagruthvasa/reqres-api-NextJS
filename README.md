# User REST API

A simple REST API built with NestJS, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ that integrates with the [Reqres](https://reqres.in/) API. This application provides endpoints for managing users and their avatars, including creating users, retrieving user data, and handling avatars.

## Features

- **POST /api/users**: Create a new user entry and send a dummy email and RabbitMQ event.
- **GET /api/user/{userId}**: Retrieve user data from Reqres.
- **GET /api/user/{userId}/avatar**: Retrieve and store the user's avatar image, returning its base64 representation.
- **DELETE /api/user/{userId}/avatar**: Remove the avatar image from the file system and delete its entry from the database.
